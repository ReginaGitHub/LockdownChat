# LockdownChat
Lockdown Chat is a real-time chat application that sends and displays messages to a recipient instantly without any page refresh. This application allows students of Nanyang Polytechnic to communicate and interact with invigilators in a multi-user environment that is usually addressed directly on the application.

### Project Objective
At that time of creation, Nanyang Polytechnic is conducting remote e-supervised assessment. Students need to use a Lockdown Browser that prevents students from navigating anywhere else except BB quiz. However, other platforms such as Padlet are not suitable as it couldnâ€™t prevent students from searching through the web browser.
Therefore, the creation of Lockdown Chat application enables students and invigilators to communicate conveniently and effectively during the conduct of remote e-supervised assessments.

### Preview
Live deployment since 2020

After the chat room is created, copy and paste the same chat room URL link to another browser to chat and interact between the browsers (both in the same room).

Simply add in "/instructor" to the URL to access invigilator's accessability after chat room is created.
