# LockdownChat
This real-time chat application allows students to communicate and interact with invigilators in a multi-user environment that is usually addressed directly on the application. This real-time chat application is created and deployed for Nanyang Polytechnic to conveniently conduct remote e-supervised assessment. Main objective is to prevent students from navigating anywhere else except the Blackboard quizzes during the conduct of remote e-supervised assessment while using the Lockdown Browser. Other platforms such as Padlet are not suitable as it couldnâ€™t prevent students from searching through the web browser.
Therefore, the creation of Lockdown Chat application has enabled students and invigilators to communicate conveniently and effectively during the conduct of remote e-supervised assessments.
